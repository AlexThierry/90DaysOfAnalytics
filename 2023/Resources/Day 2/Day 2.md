# Day 2 - 90 days of Analytics : What is data analytics ?

---

In today’s video, a comparison between a data analyst role and a data scientist role was made including the required skills needed to become a data analyst. 

The following points were mentioned

1. -Learning ML as a data analyst can permit you to become a data scientist.
2. -Data science is everywhere and in everything we do. Examples may include searching on the internet, speech processing applications, product recommendation on various websites, gaming reinforcement learning, chatbots (an example may include ChatGPT), …
3. -The analytic process is as follows 
    + **Step 1** - Problem framing: Clearly understand the problem (what problem are we trying to solve). It should be noted that a problem well framed is half solved.
    + **Step 2** - Data collection. The data could be structured, semi-structured or unstructured of any form (Text, video, audio, images, …).
    + **Step 3** - Data cleaning: Adjusting the state of the collected data to suit the purpose.
    + **Step 4** – Data exploration: Getting an insight, hidden patterns or correlation from the data after which visualisations will be produced from them. 
    + **Step 5** – Provide recommendation and action plans: Suggestions on what to next.
4. -Types of data analysis include
    + Descriptive analysis: What?
    + Diagnostic analysis: why?
    + Predictive analysis: What will happen?
    + Prescriptive analysis: How will it happen?
    + Exploratory data analysis: Identify hidden patterns in the data
5. -What companies want from a data analyst include: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, dashboard creation, production of performance reports,... 
6. -Skills needed to become a data analyst include:  
    + Soft skills which include Business understanding, mathematics and statistics, logical and analytical thinking, communication, problem solving, ...
    + Tech skills which include mastery of Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, … 
7. -It is important to note that soft skills are also important just like tech skills.
8. -Deliverables related to data include
    + Building dashboards and reports (by the data analyst)
    + Using machine learning to build prototypes (by the data scientist)
    + Build AI application, ML applications (by the machine learning engineer)
    + Using ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) and warehousing (by the Data engineer)
