# Day 3 - 90 days of Analytics: Data Analyst job requirements



Todayâ€™s video was all about checking the job descriptions for some data roles which included data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, machine learning engineer and more. It was with the objective to know what companies are requiring from us and know the skills we need to acquire while learning the data analytics program. 
The following aspects were done and mentioned
1. The job requirements for remote jobs were googled and from indeed website, requirements for the jobs were read and analysed. We noticed that they tie with what was said in the previous video. The data analyst requirements tie with what we will be learning in the 90daysofanalytics challenge.
2. It was made mention that we should not be scared of applying for jobs especially when one of the requirements necessitate some years of experience. 
3. The next step a data analyst should take is data science. Adding machine learning to his or her tool kit.
